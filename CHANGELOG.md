# dbt_apple_search_ads v0.5.0
[PR #29](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_search_ads/pull/29) includes the following updates:

## Breaking Changes: Apple Search Ads API v5 schema updates
- Following the connector updates surrounding the Apple Search Ads API v5 release, the following fields have been added to the upstream `*_report` staging models ([PR #54](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_search_ads_source/pull/54)) and will be used to sunset the below fields:
  - `tap_installs` - replacing `conversions`
  - `tap_new_downloads` - replacing `new_downloads`
  - `tap_redownloads` - replacing `redownloads`
- Following this, the end models now have the following new fields, which be used to sunset the below fields:
  - `tap_new_downloads` - replacing `new_downloads`
  - `tap_redownloads` - replacing `tap_redownloads`
  - `tap_total_downloads` - replacing `total_downloads`
  - `tap_installs` - replacing `conversions`
- In order to maintain backwards compatibility and historical data, we have coalesced the new and existing versions of each field.
- **We encourage referencing the new fields, as the fields being replaced will be deprecated by April 2025 in an upcoming release.**

## Documentation
- Added Quickstart model counts to README. ([#28](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_search_ads/pull/28))
- Corrected references to connectors and connections in the README. ([#28](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_search_ads/pull/28))
- Updated Copyright and README format.

# dbt_apple_search_ads v0.4.1
[PR #26](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_search_ads/pull/26) includes the following updates:

## Bug Fixes
- Adjusts `inner joins` in each end model to be `left joins`. 
  - When ads and other entities are deleted from Apple Search Ads, their records are hard-deleted from the `<entity>_history` source tables, though any associated `<entity>_report` records persist with new `<entity>_id` values of `-1`. This update ensures that the report records persist into the package's end models in these cases.
>**Note**: This will likely increase the row count of your data models. To remove these newly included records, filter out rows where the `<entity>_id = -1`.
- We have accordingly made sure to select fields, specifically entity IDs, from the left side of these joins (the report tables).

# dbt_apple_search_ads v0.4.0
[PR #24](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_search_ads/pull/24) includes the following **BREAKING CHANGE** updates:

## Feature Updates: Conversion Support
- Added the `conversions` source field to each `apple_search_ads__*_report` model.
- If you are already passing in these fields via the [passthrough columns](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_search_ads?tab=readme-ov-file#passing-through-additional-metrics), the package will automatically prevent "duplicate column" errors.
> Breaking change: This update impacts users not previously including `conversions` via passthrough columns.

- Since there is no direct `conversion_value` field available in Apple Search Ads data, added a `DECISIONLOG` entry discussing alternatives. See the [Conversion Value section](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_search_ads/blob/main/DECISIONLOG.md#conversion-value) for more details.

## Under the Hood
- Introduced the `apple_search_ads_persist_pass_through_columns` macro to maintain compatibility for users already passing conversion fields through passthrough columns.
  - This macro coalesces each passthrough metric with `0`.
- Added validation tests for integrity and consistency of transformation models within the `integration_tests` folder (for maintainers only).

## Documentation
- Added missing column descriptions for `keyword_id` and `keyword_text` in the `apple_search_ads__search_term_report` model.

# dbt_apple_search_ads v0.3.0
[PR #20](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_search_ads/pull/20) includes the following updates:
## Feature update ðŸŽ‰
- Unioning capability! This adds the ability to union source data from multiple apple_search_ads connectors. Refer to the [Union Multiple Connectors README section](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_search_ads/blob/main/README.md#union-multiple-connectors) for more details.

## Under the hood ðŸš˜
- In the source package, updated tmp models to union source data using the `fivetran_utils.union_data` macro. 
- To distinguish which source each field comes from, added `source_relation` column in each staging and downstream model and applied the `fivetran_utils.source_relation` macro.
  - The `source_relation` column is included in all joins in the transform package. 
- Updated tests to account for the new `source_relation` column.

# dbt_apple_search_ads v0.2.2
## Bugfix:
- Updated the dbt_utils.unique_combination_of_columns test for the `apple_search_ads__search_term_report` to include the following fields. ([PR #18](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_search_ads/pull/18)):
        - date_day
        - search_term_text
        - keyword_id
        - ad_group_id
        - campaign_id
        - organization_id
        - match_type

## Under the Hood:

- Incorporated the new `fivetran_utils.drop_schemas_automation` macro into the end of each Buildkite integration test job. ([PR #15](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_search_ads/pull/15))
- Updated the pull request [templates](/.github). ([PR #15](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_search_ads/pull/15))
