## What does this dbt package do?
- Produces modeled tables that leverage Apple Search Ads data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/apple-search-ads) in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/apple-search-ads#schemainformation).
- Enables you to better understand the performance of your ads across varying grains:
    - Providing an organization, campaign, ad group, keyword, search term and ad level reports.
- Materializes output models designed to work simultaneously with our [multi-platform Ad Reporting package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting).
- Generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your source and modeled Apple Search Ads data through the [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_apple_search_ads/).

<!--section="apple_search_ads_transformation_model"-->
The following table provides a detailed list of all tables materialized within this package by default.

| **Table** | **Details** |
|-----------|-------------|
| [`apple_search_ads__organization_report`](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_apple_search_ads/#!/model/model.apple_search_ads.apple_search_ads__organization_report) | Represents daily performance aggregated at the organization level, including `spend`, `taps`, `impressions`, and `tap_installs`.<br><br>**Example Analytics Questions:**<ul><li>How does performance compare across different accounts by account manager?</li><li>Are currency fluctuations affecting results across markets?</li></ul> |
| [`apple_search_ads__campaign_report`](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_apple_search_ads/#!/model/model.apple_search_ads.apple_search_ads__campaign_report) | Represents daily performance aggregated at the campaign level, including `spend`, `taps`, `impressions`, and `tap_installs`.<br><br>**Example Analytics Questions:**<ul><li>Which campaigns are most efficient in terms of cost per conversion?</li><li>Are paused or limited-status campaigns still accruing impressions?</li><li>Which campaigns contribute most to overall spend or conversions?</li></ul> |
| [`apple_search_ads__ad_group_report`](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_apple_search_ads/#!/model/model.apple_search_ads.apple_search_ads__ad_group_report) | Represents daily performance aggregated at the ad group level, including `spend`, `taps`, `impressions`, and `tap_installs`.<br><br>**Example Analytics Questions:**<ul><li>Which ad groups have the strongest engagement relative to their budget?</li><li>Do certain ad groups dominate impressions within a campaign?</li><li>Are new ad groups ramping up as expected after launch?</li></ul> |

Many of the above reports are now configurable for [visualization via Streamlit](https://github.com/fivetran/streamlit_ad_reporting). Check out some [sample reports here](https://fivetran-ad-reporting.streamlit.app/ad_performance).

### Example Visualizations

Curious what these tables can do? The Apple Search Ads models provide advertising performance data that can be visualized to track key metrics like spend, impressions, click-through rates, conversion rates, and return on ad spend across different campaign structures and time periods. Check out example visualizations in the [Fivetran Ad Reporting Streamlit App](https://fivetran-ad-reporting.streamlit.app/ad_performance), and see how you can use these tables in your own reporting. Below is a screenshot of an example dashboard; explore the app for more.

### Materialized Models
Each Quickstart transformation job run materializes 26 models if all components of this data model are enabled. This count includes all staging, intermediate, and final models materialized as `view`, `table`, or `incremental`.
<!--section-end-->

## How do I use the dbt package?

### Step 1: Prerequisites
To use this dbt package, you must have the following:

- At least one Fivetran Apple Search Ads connection syncing data into your destination.
- A **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, **PostgreSQL**, or **Databricks** destination.

#### Databricks Dispatch Configuration
If you are using a Databricks destination with this package you will need to add the below (or a variation of the below) dispatch configuration within your `dbt_project.yml`. This is required in order for the package to accurately search for macros within the `dbt-labs/spark_utils` then the `dbt-labs/dbt_utils` packages respectively.
```yml
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt_utils
    search_order: ['spark_utils', 'dbt_utils']
```

### Step 2: Install the package (skip if also using the `ad_reporting` combo package)
Include the following apple_search_ads package version in your `packages.yml` file _if_ you are not also using the upstream [Ad Reporting combination package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting):
> TIP: Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.
```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/apple_search_ads
    version: [">=1.0.0", "<1.1.0"] # we recommend using ranges to capture non-breaking changes automatically
```

> All required sources and staging models are now bundled into this transformation package. Do not include `fivetran/apple_search_ads_source` in your `packages.yml` since this package has been deprecated.

### Step 3: Define database and schema variables
By default, this package runs using your destination and the `apple_search_ads` schema. If this is not where your Apple Search Ads data is (for example, if your Apple Search Ads schema is named `apple_search_ads_fivetran`), add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
    apple_search_ads_database: your_destination_name
    apple_search_ads_schema: your_schema_name 
```

### (Optional) Step 4: Additional configurations
<details open><summary>Expand/Collapse details</summary>

#### Union multiple connections
If you have multiple apple_search_ads connections in Fivetran and would like to use this package on all of them simultaneously, we have provided functionality to do so. The package will union all of the data together and pass the unioned table into the transformations. You will be able to see which source it came from in the `source_relation` column of each model. To use this functionality, you will need to set either the `apple_search_ads_union_schemas` OR `apple_search_ads_union_databases` variables (cannot do both) in your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
    apple_search_ads_union_schemas: ['apple_search_ads_usa','apple_search_ads_canada'] # use this if the data is in different schemas/datasets of the same database/project
    apple_search_ads_union_databases: ['apple_search_ads_usa','apple_search_ads_canada'] # use this if the data is in different databases/projects but uses the same schema name
```
> NOTE: The native `source.yml` connection set up in the package will not function when the union schema/database feature is utilized. Although the data will be correctly combined, you will not observe the sources linked to the package models in the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This happens because the package includes only one defined `source.yml`.

To connect your multiple schema/database sources to the package models, follow the steps outlined in the [Union Data Defined Sources Configuration](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_fivetran_utils/tree/releases/v0.4.latest#union_data-source) section of the Fivetran Utils documentation for the union_data macro. This will ensure a proper configuration and correct visualization of connections in the DAG.

#### Adding passthrough metrics
By default, this package will select `taps`, `impressions`, `spend` (aliased from source `local_spend_amount` field), `new_downloads`, `redownloads`, `total_downloads` (sum of `new_downloads` and `redownloads`), `conversions` (installs resulting from a view or a tap), `tap_new_downloads`, `tap_redownloads`, `tap_installs` (these last 3 fields are replacing `new_downloads`, `redownloads`, `conversions`, respectively, which will be deprecated in an upcoming release) from the source reporting tables to store into the staging models. If you would like to pass through additional metrics to the staging models, add the below configurations to your `dbt_project.yml` file. These variables allow for the pass-through fields to be aliased (`alias`) if desired, but not required. Use the below format for declaring the respective pass-through variables.

> NOTE: There is no direct `conversion_value` field available in Apple Search Ads data. See the [DECISIONLOG](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_search_ads/blob/main/DECISIONLOG.md#conversion-value) for more details on alternatives.

```yml
vars:
    apple_search_ads__ad_group_passthrough_metrics: 
      - name: "new_custom_field"
        alias: "custom_field"
      - name: "another_one"
    apple_search_ads__ad_passthrough_metrics:
      - name: "this_field"
    apple_search_ads__campaign_passthrough_metrics:
      - name: "unique_string_field"
        alias: "field_id"
    apple_search_ads__keyword_passthrough_metrics:
      - name: "that_field"
    apple_search_ads__search_term_passthrough_metrics:
      - name: "other_id"
        alias: "another_id"
```

> IMPORTANT: Make sure to exercise due diligence when adding metrics to these models. The metrics added by default have been vetted by the Fivetran team, maintaining this package for accuracy. There are metrics included within the source reports, such as metric averages, which may be inaccurately represented at the grain for reports created in this package. You must ensure that whichever metrics you pass through are appropriate to aggregate at the respective reporting levels in this package.

#### Disabling Additional Models
Your Apple Search Ads connection might not sync every table this package expects. If your syncs exclude certain tables, you either don't use that functionality in Apple Search Ads or actively exclude some tables from your syncs. You must add the relevant variables to disable the corresponding functionality in the package. By default, the package assumes that all variables are true. Add variables for only the tables you want to disable.

The `apple_search_ads__using_search_terms` variable below refers to the `search_terms_report` table. You must enable the [search match](https://searchads.apple.com/help/campaigns/0006-understand-search-match) function within each ad group to populate this table with data.

The `apple_search_ads__using_search_terms` variable below refers to the `search_terms_report` table. You must enable the [search match](https://searchads.apple.com/help/campaigns/0006-understand-search-match) function within each ad group to populate this table with data.

```yml
# dbt_project.yml
vars:
  apple_search_ads__using_search_terms: False # by default this is True
```

#### Change the build schema
By default, this package builds the Apple Search Ads staging models (10 views, 10 tables) within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_apple_search_ads_source`) and your Apple Search Ads modeling models (6 tables) within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_apple_search_ads`) in your destination. If this is not where you would like your Apple Search Ads data to be written to, add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
models:
    apple_search_ads:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # Leave +schema: blank to use the default target_schema.
      staging:
        +schema: my_new_schema_name # Leave +schema: blank to use the default target_schema.
```

#### Change the source table references
If an individual source table has a different name than the package expects, add the table name as it appears in your destination to the respective variable. This is not available when running the package on multiple unioned connections.

> IMPORTANT: See this project's [`dbt_project.yml`](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_search_ads/blob/main/dbt_project.yml) variable declarations to see the expected names.

```yml
vars:
    apple_search_ads_<default_source_table_name>_identifier: your_table_name 
```
